# ASCII-Art-To-Shell-Command
A web app written in HTML5 and vanilla JS to turn ASCII art into an easy to paste shell command.

## Instructions
To use, paste the art into the "Paste Art in Here" box. Then, select your shell type and whether you want a newline at the beginning of the command and press "Convert." You can then click "Copy" to copy the resulting command.
